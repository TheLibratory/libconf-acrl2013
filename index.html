                        <p>The University of Texas Libraries on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin has been selected as one of five regional sites to host the ACRL Workshop: &#8220;Scholarly Communication: From Understanding to Engagement.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>The workshop will be led by Ada Emmett and William Cross and held in the Perry-Casta&#241;eda Library on Friday June 21, 2013. This program is being brought to Central Texas to advance understanding of scholarly communication issues throughout the state and the Southwest region. We hope you can join us.</p>
                        <p>This day of learning will be free of charge to participants because costs for this workshop have been underwritten by ACRL, with additional support from the University of Texas Libraries. Austin Community College Library Services and Texas A&amp;M University Libraries are co-sponsor participants. We thank the Texas A&amp;M Libraries for generously sponsoring breakfast and morning coffee to get everyone off to a good start!</p>
